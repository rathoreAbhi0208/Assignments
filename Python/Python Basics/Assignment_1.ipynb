    "#### 2. What is the difference between string and variable?\n",
    "**Ans:** A Variable is used to store of information, and a String is a type of information you would store in a Variable. A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it. Example: x = 5, y = \"John\". Here x and y are variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "A String is a group of characters or a single character usually enclosed in Double quotes `\" \"` or single quotes `' '`.\n",
    "Even triple quotes can be used in Python but generally used to represent multiline strings and docstrings. Example: my_string = 'Hello'"

    "2. **float data type**: float data type is used to represent floating point values (decimal values) Example: flo_num=19.34\n",

    "    Expressions need to be evaluated. If we ask Python to print an expression, the interpreter \n",
    "    evaluates the expression and displays the result. An expression is evaluated as per the precedence of its operators. So that if there is more than one operator in an expression, their precedence decides which operation will be performed first."

A statement is an instruction that a Python interpreter can execute.
